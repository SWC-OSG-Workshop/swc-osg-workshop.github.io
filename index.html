<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>
The <em> SWC-OSG-Workshop </em> is a github organization. 
Under this organization, we create repositories that contain the course 
materials for the sofware carpentry and open science grid workshops. The parent 
reposityr is <em> general </em>.  The  <em> general </em> repository contains the basic learning modules and necessary tools to set up the workshop front 
page. Using <em> general </em> as the template, we will generate workshop 
specific repositories. 
</p>


</br> 
<p>
As soon as the workshop date is finalized, create a repo by the name 
"YYYY-MM-DD", where YYYY is the year, MM is the month and DD is the date of the workshop.  In your local Desktop or Laptop,  type  the following
<ul> 

<li> git clone https://github.com/SWC-OSG-Workshop/YYYY-MM-DD.git
<li> cd YYYY-MM-DD </li> 
<li> git checkout -b gh-pages </li> 
<li> git remote add general https://github.com/SWC-OSG-Workshop/general.git </li> 
<li> git pull origin gh-pages </li> 
<li> git remote remove general </li> 
</ul> 

To create the front page for the workshop, follow the steps 
outlined in the README.md file that is located at the <em> gh-pages </em> 
branch of the newly created YYYY-MM-DD repository.
