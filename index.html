<h1>  Creating Workshop Specific Repository</h1>


<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>
The <em> SWC-OSG-Workshop </em> is a github organization. 
Under this organization, we create repositories that contain the course 
materials for the sofware carpentry and open science grid workshops. The parent 
repositry is <a href="https://github.com/SWC-OSG-Workshop/general.git"> <em> general</em></a> that contains the basic learning modules 
and necessary tools to set up new workshop website. Using 
<a href="https://github.com/SWC-OSG-Workshop/general.git"><em>general</em></a> 
repo as the template, we will generate workshop specific 
repositories. 

The generated repository needs to have the course materials 
and the front page of the website for a workshop.   
</p>
</br> 

<h2>New Repo for a New Workshop</h2>
<p>
As soon as the workshop date is finalized, create a repo by the name 
"YYYY-MM-DD", where YYYY is the year, MM is the month and DD is the 
date of the workshop. The generated repository needs to have the 
course material and web content for a workshop. Since we have all 
the materials under the general repo, we copy the course material and web 
content from the general repo. In your local Desktop or Laptop, type  
the followings
<ul> 
<li> git clone https://github.com/SWC-OSG-Workshop/YYYY-MM-DD.git
<li> cd YYYY-MM-DD </li> 
<li> git checkout -b gh-pages </li> 
<li> git remote add general https://github.com/SWC-OSG-Workshop/general.git </li> 
<li> git pull general gh-pages </li> 
<li> git remote remove general </li> 
</ul> 


To create the front page for the workshop, follow the steps 
outlined in the README.md file located at the <em> gh-pages </em> 
branch of the newly created YYYY-MM-DD repository.
