<h1> Creating Workshop Specific Repository</h1>
Welcome OSG team. The current page provides guidelines to set up a the documentation and the web-page for the software carpentry workshop. All our 
documentations for the workshop are hosted at github under the organization 
<em> SWC-OSG-Workshop </em>. In particular, the repository <a href="https://github.com/SWC-OSG-Workshop/general.git"> contains materials common for all the 
upcoming or planned future workshops. The materials include the lessons and 
the content for the front page of the workshop. We will copy  
<a href="https://github.com/SWC-OSG-Workshop/general.git"><em>general</em></a> 
repo for each new workshop and tweek the materials. 
</p>
</br> 

<h2>New Repo for a New Workshop</h2>
<p>
As soon as the workshop date is finalized, create a repo by the name 
"YYYY-MM-DD", where YYYY is the year, MM is the month and DD is the 
date of the workshop. The generated repository needs to have the 
course material and web content for a workshop. Since we have all 
the materials under the general repo, we copy the course material and web 
content from the general repo. In your local Desktop or Laptop, type  
the followings
<ul> 
<li> git clone https://github.com/SWC-OSG-Workshop/YYYY-MM-DD.git
<li> cd YYYY-MM-DD </li> 
<li> git checkout -b gh-pages </li> 
<li> git remote add general https://github.com/SWC-OSG-Workshop/general.git </li> 
<li> git pull general gh-pages </li> 
<li> git remote remove general </li> 
</ul> 


To create the front page for the workshop, follow the steps 
outlined in the README.md file located at the <em> gh-pages </em> 
branch of the newly created YYYY-MM-DD repository.
